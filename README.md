Hello! This project was inspired by FreeCodeCamp's Calorie Counter project, which is part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) certification. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of basic JavaScript. With the help of FreeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, ChatGPT, and YouTube tutorials, I am continuously improving my foundational knowledge. One day, I would love to enhance this project by adding a 'Save Task' feature that allows users to save their tasks in separate folders for different days.
